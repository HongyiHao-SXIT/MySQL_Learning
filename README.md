# MySQL8.0 Database
## Repository Introduction
This repository aims to assist everyone in self - learning the MySQL 8.0 database management system and provides solutions and learning materials for the experiments related to the courses offered by Shanxi Institute of Technology. Whether you are a beginner looking to quickly get started with MySQL or a student participating in the SXIT courses hoping to successfully complete the experiments, this will be a valuable resource library.

## Main Contents
Self-learning materials: Include a self-study area for writing SQL statements and conducting experiments based on the textbook MySQL 8.0 Database Application and Development (edited by Jiang Guihong and published by Tsinghua University Press).<br>
Experiment codes: Provide detailed code implementations and experiment report templates for the experiments assigned in the courses of Shanxi Institute of Technology. Through these experiments, you can apply the theoretical knowledge you've learned to real projects and deepen your understanding of database management.
## Usage Instructions
### Self - learning MySQL
Begin from the tutorials directory and gradually learn the basic knowledge and advanced features of MySQL step by step according to the textbook.
Combine the sample code in the tutorials and carry out practical operations in your local MySQL environment to deepen your understanding.
### Completing SXIT Course Experiments
Enter the experiments directory and locate the corresponding experiment folder.
Check the experiment requirements and code implementations, and make modifications and expansions according to your own needs.
## Precautions
### Academic Integrity
The content of this repository is only for learning and reference purposes. It is strictly prohibited to use it for any behavior that violates academic integrity. When completing the SXIT course experiments, please think independently and complete the experiment reports and code implementations by yourself. Plagiarizing others' achievements not only violates academic ethics but also affects your mastery of knowledge and personal growth.
If you encounter difficulties during the learning process, you can refer to the materials in this repository. However, make sure that you truly understand the relevant knowledge and can express it in your own words and code. Meanwhile, you are encouraged to communicate and discuss with your classmates and teachers to progress together.
### Contribution
If you have new learning materials, experiment codes, or study notes during the learning process, you are welcome to contribute to this repository via a Pull Request so that more people can benefit.
### Feedback
If you encounter any problems or have improvement suggestions while using this repository, please feel free to raise them in the Issues section. We will deal with them as soon as possible.
